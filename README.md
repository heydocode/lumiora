# 🌟 LumioraOS  

## 🚀 Vision  

LumioraOS is an open-source operating system built with the goal of creating a minimalist and powerful OS for RISC-V architecture. It empowers developers to contribute to a project where every idea and contribution is recognized, valued, and celebrated. This OS is not just a technical project—it’s a **community-driven effort** where success is **shared** among **all contributors**.  

## 🎯 Goals  

LumioraOS is designed to achieve the following:  

- **Minimalistic Design**: A lightweight and clean system that focuses on simplicity and usability.  
- **Fancy GUI**: An advanced graphical interface inspired by console OS designs, tailored for both developers and everyday users.  
- **Support for External Apps**: While not all apps are included out of the box, users can easily download and install external software.  
- **Gaming Support**: A simplified console-like UI with built-in support for games.  

##### ⚠️ Note: Of course, only apps and games specifically supported by the OS are functional. While these goals represent the future, I am committed to bringing that future closer with your help!  

## 🙌 Why Contribute?  

The LumioraOS project thrives on **openness**, **collaboration**, and **shared achievement**. Here’s why you should join:  

- **Acknowledgement**: Every contributor gets a dedicated mention in the `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` file, ensuring your efforts are celebrated and remembered.  
- **Shared Success**: Success is divided among the contributors—your impact matters.  
- **Community-Driven**: Your voice and ideas will help shape the future of LumioraOS.  

## 📝 Acknowledgement and Recognition  

There have been **too many** impressive contributions made to the [Octox repo](https://github.com/o8vm/octox) that have unfortunately gone unrecognized due to the contribution policies of that repository. To honor those efforts, including those of the **Octox author**, LumioraOS will include a dedicated `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` file where **every contributor** will be properly recognized for their **ideas and efforts**.
